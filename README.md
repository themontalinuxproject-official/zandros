# ZandrOS

ZandrOS is a operating system project designed to provide users with a nostalgic experience, inspired by the computing environments of the past. The main goal of ZandrOS is to build an operating system that recreates the feeling of older systems while incorporating modern technologies.
This project has two stages:
## Project Stages

### Stage 1: Text-based DOS Interface
In the first stage, ZandrOS will feature a text-based, DOS-like interface. This stage will focus on the core functionality of the operating system, including file management, process handling, and system utilities. The text interface will allow users to interact with the OS through a command-line interface (CLI), offering a retro feel reminiscent of the early days of personal computing.

### Stage 2: Windows 9x-inspired Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The second stage will introduce a graphical user interface inspired by the Windows 9x series. This phase will aim to bring a nostalgic desktop environment to life, including elements like windows, icons, taskbars, and basic graphical tools. It will allow users to interact with the system through a more modern, visual interface while still preserving the old-school charm of earlier operating systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Assembly (ASM)**: Low-level operations, bootloader, and hardware interaction.
- **C Language**: Core system functionality, drivers, and higher-level services.

## Features (Planned)
- **Stage 1 (Text-based UI)**:
  - Command-line interface.
  - Basic file management system.
  - Essential system utilities (e.g., text editor, file viewer).

- **Stage 2 (Graphical UI)**:
  - Windows 9x-inspired environment.
  - Taskbar and window management.
  - Simple file explorer.
  - Support for icons and graphical elements.

## Contributing
I need your help for this project due to lack of my C knowledge. Thanks for everyone helps/helped.
